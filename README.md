# :christmas_tree: :sparkles: Mustafa's Advent of Code 2021 Solutions:sparkles: :christmas_tree:

I wanted to make a list of solutions to Advent of Code 2021, chanced upon [mimikrija](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2020)'s repository, and I'm now more I'm inspired enough to document my progress.  

My goals are:

1. Get better at Python :snake:
2.  Make as many mistakes as possible for the best "TIL" experiences!
